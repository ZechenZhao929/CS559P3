**I'm sure you've all played the game Push the Box. In this game, the character pushes a wooden box to a specific location to complete the level. What if it's a little more difficult? How about pushing a dice? A dice has six different numbered faces, and the player needs to control the character to place the specified face in the specified location. This might be a little more challenging and fun than the usual Push the Box.**
